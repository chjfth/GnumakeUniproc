@This project demonstrates how to use a plugin. The plugin used in this example
is PI_always_compile.

This project consists of two C source files: main.c and nowdate.c , and 
we'd like nowdate.c to be always compiled. In order to do this, we need 
the extra two steps:

1. Load the plugin PI_always_compile in exe.mki:
=======
gmp_u_list_PLUGIN_TO_LOAD += PI_always_compile
=======

2. In u_srccfg_post.mki, tell which files should be always compiled:
=======
gmi_ALCP_up_list_SRC_ALWAYS_COMPILE_FROM_ROOT = nowdate.c
=======

That's it.
