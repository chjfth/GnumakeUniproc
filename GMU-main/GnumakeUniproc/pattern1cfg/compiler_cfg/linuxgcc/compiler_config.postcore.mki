	#	[2006-05-08] Since gmp_linuxgcc_ud_list_SYSTEM_HEADER is an env-var we designate
	# to indicate the "system"(stable) include dirs, and it is not recognized by
	# gcc internally(i.e. unlike INCLUDE env-var for MSVC), therefore, we have to
	# append these dirs explicitly as gcc's arguments.
	# BTW: These -isystem options are place in the XXX.postcore.mki, so that they're
	# listed after user adds something to them in u_srccfg_post.mki .
