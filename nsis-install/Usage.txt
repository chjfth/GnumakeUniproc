How to generate the NSIS installer package for GnumakeUniproc/

Two ways:

=== The Simple Way (for nlscan staff) ===

Just run export-at-office.bat, then you have everything exported into a directory called nsis-data.

Compile GMU-nsis.nsi with NSIS 2.46.

SPECIAL NOTE: Large string(8192 bytes) version of makensis.exe(and Stubs) are suggested to build
GMU-nsis.nsi . 

The standard 1024-byte version has such a problem on Windows 7: 
    If PATH env-var is larger than 1024 bytes, ``ReadEnvStr $1 PATH``(in AddToPath.nsh) will get 
empty string in $1, and the result is: Running the installer exe multiple times will have 
D:\GMU\GMU-main\umake_cmd\wincmd added to PATH multiple times as well.



=== The Verbose Way (for Internet users) ===

Step 1: 

Run export-gmu.bat to export everything that will get packed into an NSIS installer package.
e.g.
	export-gmu.bat https://gnumakeuniproc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnumakeuniproc
GMU core files will be exported to subdir nsis-data .

Step 2:

Prepare Windows binary tools in two specific directories.
Binary tools: gmuCountChar.exe etc
You can get those files from a stock GMU .exe distribution. For their correct locations,
refer to export-at-office.bat.log .


Step 3:
	Compile GMU-nsis.nsi with NSIS 2.46.
