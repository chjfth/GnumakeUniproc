How to generate the NSIS installer package for GnumakeUniproc/

Two ways:

=== The Simple Way (for nlscan staff) ===

Just run export-at-office.bat, then you have everything exported into a directory called nsis-data.

Compile GMU-nsis.nsi with NSIS 2.46.


=== The Verbose Way (for Internet users) ===

Step 1: 

Run export-gmu.bat to export everything that will get packed into an NSIS installer package.
e.g.
	export-gmu.bat https://gnumakeuniproc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnumakeuniproc
GMU core files will be exported to subdir nsis-data .

Step 2:

Prepare Windows binary tools in two specific directories.
Binary tools: gmuCountChar.exe etc
You can get those files from a stock GMU .exe distribution. For their correct locations,
refer to export-at-office.bat.log .


Step 3:
	Compile GMU-nsis.nsi with NSIS 2.46.
