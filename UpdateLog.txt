[2010-05-06] v0.96
Main feature of this release is Windows Vista SP1 and Windows 7 support. A few bugs are fixed as well.
===== Changes and Improvements: =====
1. r850 (incompatible change)
	Deprecate gmu-var gmp_COMPILER_VER, introduce gmp_COMPILER_VER_<compiler-id>. From now on, compiler version string for different compilers can co-exist peacefully. Update walkdir-msvc-multiver example accordingly.
2. r803-835 (Windows specific)
	Great improvement: Introduce new native Win32 port of Bourne Shell(winbash), code derived from http://sourceforge.net/projects/win-bash (2006-03-06 release, v0.6). With some code improvements, it works with GnumakeUniproc. From now on, GnumakeUniproc is supported on Windows Vista SP1 and later and Windows 7.
	With this new sh.exe, the shabby gmu_IS_USING_POOR_SH_EXE=1 no longer needs to exist.
3. r833 (Windows specific)
	make.exe binary is recompiled with a minor code modification. When env-var gmu_SUPPRESS_INCLUDE_NOT_FOUND_WARNING=1 is defined, make will not output those (almost-) meaningless "No such file or directory" warning. This new env-var is now set by GMU Windows installer.
4. r842,r845
	Improvement: When building an EXE project, if its linkage list is changed compared to last build, I will do relink.
5. r847
	Some gmu-var name change. Old names can still be used but discouraged.
	* gmu_DELIBERATE_NO_SUBPRJ -> gmu_FREE_STYLE_MAKEFILE
	* gmu_IGNORE_SUBPRJS       -> gmu_DO_IGNORE_SUBPRJS 
6. r797,r854
	Fix Linux install script install-exe.sh .


[2009-12-22] v0.95
This is mostly a maintenance and bug-fix release, fixed some very subtle bugs. Only a few new features are added.
===== Changes and Improvements: =====
1. r795 (incompatible change)
	For msvc/compiler_config.mki, abandon single-threaded CRT option. At the same time, use make-var gmp_bc_CRT_STATIC_LIB to tell whether use static CRT lib or dynamically-linked CRT DLL.
2. r795 
	Add PI_use_mfc plugin, -- for Windows programs using MFC. (not thoroughly tested with MSVC8 and MSVC9)
3. r772,r773,r780
	Improve those umake* batch/script to eliminate duplicate code. Those duplicate code are now in umake-share.
4. r779
	Update install scripts on linux, so that user do not have to cd into GMU-main to execute them.
5. r780 (experimental, tested on Ubuntu 9.10)
	Improvement: (Linux) In umake script, Check for /bin/sh 's behavior, if not Bourne shell or Bash, force SHELL=/bin/bash on make command line. -- encountered on Ubuntu Linux 9.10.
6. r785
	New feature: If gmu_DO_SHOW_COMPILEE_FULLPATH=1, I will show the fullpath of a file being compiled. That's great when a user sees a file being compiled and immediately wants to get its path and open it.
7. r784 
	Include GMSL 1.0.11 into GnumakeUniproc. (GMSL is from http://gmsl.sourceforge.net) 

===== Example and Doc Update: =====
1. r752-755 (Visual C++ only)
	Add dll-2libs example to show how we can construct two LIBs project into one DLL project with minimum project maintenance human overhead. Description of the rationale is updated.


[2009-01-02] v0.94
===== Changes and Improvements: =====
1. r546
	Generate building_list.gmu.txt as well as built_list.gmu.txt simultaneously. Now building_list.gmu.txt shows you the call stack(build stack) of your project. It is very helpful to check this stack info to know how you reach a specific project, especially the build fails at some project.
2. r576-580
	Add a force-postprocess feature which enables, in one GMU run, a already built project to be built(check up-to-date) again so that you can force some "post processing" action to be done within that project.
	There is an example called "force-postprocess" to demonstrate this.
3. r587-590
	Introduce new function gmuf_CombinePsSubdirs, obsolete gmp_ud_list_PS_HEADER_PARENT and gmp_PS_INCLUDE_SUBDIRS(but still supported for backward compatibility). Remove configure for gmp_PS_INCLUDE_SUBDIRS in Windows installer.
4. r596
	$(gmu_u_SHOW_PROGRESS_CMD) using enhancement. Now the progress info is updated on a project start as well as a project done, what's more, current project name is shown.
5. r607-610
	On Windows, no longer require env-var gmu_DIR_GMU_PRG .
6. r618-631,r635-636
	Great feature: LIB project cross-dependency is allowed when multi-level auto-linking is in action.
	The cross-lib-ref example demonstrates this.
7. r625
	For GMU pattern1, introduce a new stem compiler-config file: compiler_config.precore.mki , which appears after u_srccfg_post.mki but before GnumakeUniproc.mki .
8. r633
	New gmu-var gmu_u_EXTRA_LINK_MERGE: user makefile can add extra libs(e.g. system libs) for its parent project to link, so that parent projects don't have to care what system libs should be drawed in for deeper sub-projects.
9. r643
	When calling gmuf_MakeSvnRepositoryPath and the env-var for SVN root URL is null, assert with $(error ). This makes the user know immediately what env-var is missing for an SVN server.
10. r645,678
	Some semantic change for gmu_ud_OUTPUT_ROOT: When command line assigned gmu_ud_OUTPUT_ROOT is non-null, GMU start-up signature file will be created in $(gmu_ud_OUTPUT_ROOT) instead of in $(CURDIR). This prevents the directory containing start-up makefile be polluted by start-up signature file.
	Influence of this change: If using GNU make 3.80 and assigning gmu_ud_OUTPUT_ROOT at command line, umake(the batch/script) will not give you correct running result. To work around, you should manually delete $gmu_ud_OUTPTU_ROOT/_MainPrjBuildStart.gmu.ckt before running umake. GNU make 3.81 does not have this problem.
11. r646
	Remove two boring plugin-var: gmi_SYDO_DO_SYNC_DEVOUTPUT and gmi_RCVC_DO_WANT_AUTO_RC_HDEP. Now you don't need to define them to make plugin PI_sync_devoutput and PI_winres_msvc work.
12. r646
	Setting gmi_SYDO_ud_SYNC_xxx_TO in env-var is not longer suggested. Windows installer removes its config page.
13. r640,r647-650
	PI_sync_devoutput plugin now becomes more generic.
14. r659
	Update for MSVC compiler config files: Now works well when INCLUDE directories contain spaces(still to test).
15. r661
	New gmu-var gmp_LINK_DuplicateLibList=1. For linkers such as GNU ld who hastes to drop objs on LIB scanning, 	you can define this so that the LIB list is duplicated on link command line to make ld get those "missing" objs.
16. r677
	Experimental: Introduce new gmu-var: gmu_p_StartupMakefile, gmu_d_StartupMakefile, gmu_d_StartupParent, then, in pattern1 mks, use those vars to refer to the dir and parent dir of start-up makefile so that umake is no longer required to be launch from the same dir as start-up makefile. Of course, for this to work, user makefile should use these vars instead of using relative path.
17. r682
	Fix for PI_use_pch_msvc plugin. Now always pass the so-called stdafx.obj to the linker to avoid possible problem.
18. r683
	Introduce new user-var gmp_up_USER_OUTPUT_AFTER_LINK(more intuitive) to replace the old gmp_USER_FIRST_TARGET(still support the old one).
19. r686
	Write checkout and export command to local-dir receiving that checkout/export, in filename _CheckoutCmd.gmu.txt . gmu_NO_LOG_CO_CMD_TO_FILE=1 can suppress it.
20. r704
	Introduce custom command $(gmp_LINK_OUTPUT_POSTPROC_CMD) which is designed solely for the situation $(gmu_Gp_LINK_OUTPUT) should be processed after link, e.g. strip it, UPX pack it, digital sign it etc.
21. r709
	Add two more prjname decoration gmu-var: gmu_DECO_PREFIX_PRJ_FORCE_ENV & gmu_DECO_SUFFIX_PRJ_FORCE_ENV. These are set by user in the environment and will influence all levels of subprjs.
22. r716
	Add function gmuf_GetAbsPathByRela_so , translate relative path to absolute path, without calling shell's cd command. 
23. r720
	Make -fpic as gcc's default compile flags. However, you can use gmu-var gmp_GCC_CFLAGS_PIC to override it.
24. Change GnumakeUniproc SVN repository dir structure, now trunk/tags/branches in repository root. 

===== Example and Doc Update: =====
1: r547-r555,r594
	Move quick-start guide examples(walkdir) to GMU-examples dir, so that these projects can be easily tested with $gmu_DIR_ROOT/GMU-examples/make-all .
	Merge together quick-start guide Linux version and Windows version for easier maintenance.
2: r556
	Add dll-from-lib example project, making a DLL by linking(packing) LIB project(s).
3: r575
	Add gmp_DECO_DEBUG_FOR_LINK_OUTPUT=1 for walkdir lib, so that Debug version and Release version of the same LIB can be placed in the same dir. (It's one kind of SDK design strategy.)
4: r600-r601
	Add mix-compiler-ver example demonstrating using two different version of a same compiler in one GMU build session.
6: r687
	Add KeyView2 example to demonstrate usage of gmp_up_USER_OUTPUT_AFTER_LINK .
7: r701
	Add gtktetris example to demonstrate PI_use_pch_gcc plugin .
8: Add workable WinCE compiler config files(gmp_COMPILER_ID=wince) as a kick start sample for building WinCE applications with Visual Studio 2005 compiler. Check $gmu_DIR_ROOT\GMU-main\GnumakeUniproc\pattern1cfg\compiler_cfg\wince\readme-for-gmu-user.txt for more details.


[2008-04-25] v0.93

1. r439
    !!INTERFACE CHANGE: No longer set default values for gmp_CFLAGS_CODE_GEN, gmp_CFLAGS_MACRO_DEFS, gmp_LINKFLAGS. If users want the default compiler flags or link flags from the templates, they should copy flags from gmp_CFLAGS_CODE_GEN_preset, gmp_CFLAGS_MACRO_DEFS_preset and gmp_LINKFLAGS_preset. And those u_srccfg_post.mki templates have been updated to do so. You probrably have to modify your existing makefiles(according to how the templates change) to accommodate this change. Sorry for the change.
2. r436-V437
    Add plugin PI_MIDL (Microsoft interface definition compiler). It helps compile your odl files(tested with MSVC6).
3. When calling `gcc -M', define -D_GMU_GCC_M_GEN_HDEPEND on command line, so that some conscious C/C++ source code can use this macro to hide some headers or C/C++ statements from being seen by `gcc -M'.
4. r446
    Enable gmp_USER_FIRST_TARGET for pattern1-container .
5. r448
    New gmu-var gmu_DELIBERATE_NO_SUBPRJ, which makes container-project a free style one, i.e. no need to really contain sub-projects . This is useful to integrate non-gmu makefiles into GMU makefile chain.
6. r449-451
    Rename _gmu_log.txt to _gmu_log.txt.bak instead of overwritting it when a new GMU run starts.
7. r456
    Change: Load custom-image-type mki inclusion adhead of compiler_config.mki, so that custom-image-type can be a virtual image-type, and real image-type can be redefined by the custom-image-type mki. This can be very helpful when maintaining some kind of cross-platform projects.
8. r464
    For MSVC: PDB file is generated at correct place with correct name instead of using the default VCx0.pdb, e.g. ABC.lib corresponds to ABC.lib.VCx0.pdb. Copy those .pdb along with .lib and they works smoothly.
9. r469,r482,r484
    For MSVC: Add plugin PI_sync_pdb_msvc, -- copy the .pdb & .idb files for a debug image to the same place where $(gmu_Gp_LINK_OUTPUT) resides (with help of plugin PI_sync_devoutput).
10. r465
    !Design change(affects pattern and plugin user): No longer force deco $(gmp_COMPILER_VER) globally, and gmp_COMPILER_VER may be a mix of multiple compiler versions. See comments in bc_deco_prjname.mki .
11. r466
    PI_sync_devoutput plugin update: Allow customized copy commands.
12. r467
    Add function gmuf_OutputInfo_e to output multiple line of text.
13. r467
    Now CVS/SVN action is counted,  summary displayed after done GMU run.
14. r473
    Running info output update: Show ${SubPrj}_MakeVarDefines when verbose-level=1. This is important because different make-var defines could affect make process very differently.
15. r478
    Now gmu_ud_OUTPUT_ROOT can be assigned as a relative dir.
16. r479
    Minor change: msvc-config: No longer add CrtMD to project output dir, since it is the ultimate default.
17. r484
    Add new make-var gmu_list_PLUGIN_TO_LOAD_ENV_PRE and gmu_list_PLUGIN_TO_LOAD_ENV_POST , so that plugins loading directive can be assigned from env-var .
18. r488
    Important fix: Will decorate prj-name when gmp_CONTAINER_EXTRACT_COMPILER_ID.
19. r489
    Improvement: For <refname>_MakeVarDefines, allow using double quotes now. Example:
refname_MakeVarDefines="PI_sync_debug_info PI_sync_devoutput"
20. r492
    Behavior fix: unexport gmu_DECO_PREFIX_PRJ_NAME gmu_DECO_SUFFIX_PRJ_NAME gmu_DECO_PREFIX_LINK_OUTPUT gmu_DECO_SUFFIX_LINK_OUTPUT. Use unexport for these four vars so that their values defined from env can be passed to subprjs, but value += to these in makefiles will not be visible to subprjs.
21. r495-497
    For gcc: Set default ``gmp_CFLAGS_MACRO_DEFS_preset += -fvisibility=hidden'', so that when linking .so, symbols/functions default to be local(hidden). For explicitly export symbols/functions, user should declare their symbols/functions with __attribute__((visibility("default"))). For old gcc versions that don't support this option, you can define gmp_GCC_OLDVER_NO_FVISIBILITY=1 to suppress this behavior
22. r501
    Add gmp_USER_PRE_TARGETS (pair up with gmp_USER_POST_TARGETS). Thus, something can be done before $(gmp_USER_FIRST_TARGET) -- this add another level of flexibility(or complexity?) .
23. r504
    New feature: By setting env-var gmu_u_SHOW_PROGRESS_CMD to a properly shell command, you can display build progress(update once every project done) info on your user interface. Run gmu-goody.bat to know how it works.
24. r526
    Rename build_list.gmu.txt to built_list.gmu.txt, which implies an item in the list appears only after a project has been successfully built. Additionally you can define env-var gmu_BUILT_LIST_INDENT=1 to make an indented output of projects being built and already built, -- this lets you easily find out project building stack.



[2007-10-05] v0.92

1. r378
 Fix: Now search custom-image-type mki in $(gmu_DIR_GNUMAKEUNIPROC)/pattern1cfg/plugins, 
 instead of in $(gmu_DIR_GNUMAKEUNIPROC). I remember this should be the only major place
 that makes GnumakeUniproc v0.92 incompatible with v0.91 .

2. r385
 New: introduce env-var gmu_DIR_ROOT to indicate the root dir of GnumakeUniproc. 
 Auto-checkout demo will rely on this var to locate CVS/SVN repository location.

3. r386 (NSIS installer)
 On installation, record install target dir to registry([HKCU\Software\GnumakeUniproc] 
 InstallTargetDir=D:\GMU) so that a second install can know where the previous install 
 dir reside. --useful if the user did not install to the default dir(D:\GMU).

4. r387, r398
 Write project build list to file $(gmu_ud_OUTPUT_ROOT)/build_list.gmu.txt

5. r391-r392
 Add make DLL example, using zlib-1.2.3's code (Windows & Linux).

6. r397
 msvc/compiler_config.mki: write obj & lib list into a file to reduce link command line 
 length.

7. r393-r418
 Add auto-checkout demo projects. SVN & CVS repositories are stored on local
 machine so that checkout can be

8. r399- (docs)
 Add "GMU var reference"(gmu-vars.htm, still under construction) & "CVS related gmuvars"
 (cvs-vars.htm)
