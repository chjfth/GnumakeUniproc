Content in this directory is mostly from GNU make 3.81's w32/subproc directory, where high quality 
sub-process creation code is provided. These code does very well on transforming Unix style process 
creation parameters(argv, envp) to Windows style CreateProcess parameters(lpCommandLine, lpEnvironment).
