<p>This KeyView2 program is provided by Charles Petzold's famous book <i>Programming Windows 5th-ed</i>.</p>


<p>KeyView2 shows you <code>WM_KEYUP</code>,<code> WM_KEYDOWN</code>, <code>WM_CHAR </code>messages received by your Windows GUI application.</p>
<p>User hint: If you want to see non-English characters in <code>WM_CHAR</code> message, you have to compile this program in Unicode mode. Using GnumakeUniproc, use <tt>umakeU.bat</tt> to do the Unicode compile.</p>
<p>KeyView2 is included as an GMU example to demonstrate the use of GMU user input var <code>gmp_up_USER_OUTPUT_AFTER_LINK </code>. We want to zip the EXE output <tt>KeyView2.exe</tt> into <tt>KeyView2.exe.zip</tt> every time the exe image is updated, that is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a GMU run, if the source file is up-to-date and the EXE output is intact, the zip operation should not be run. </li>
  <li>In a GMU run, if the source file has been changed and the EXE output is re-generated, the zip operation should be run to generate a new zip file.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to accomplish this goal, you should write your makefiles as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Before GMU core(in <tt>exe.mki</tt>), define <code>gmp_up_USER_OUTPUT_AFTER_LINK</code> to your customed output filename(most time, should be a fullpath) .</li>
  <li>After GMU core(in <tt>u_post_gmucore.mki</tt>), define your rule for target <code>gmp_up_USER_OUTPUT_AFTER_LINK</code> . In this rule, you launch the zip command to zip the EXE output.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: If you do a full install of GMU's Windows installer, zip.exe(from Info-ZIP website) is ready for you in the same dir as umakeU.bat, otherwise, you have to prepare a zip command in your PATH env-var yourself. </p>
