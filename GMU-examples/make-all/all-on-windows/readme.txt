In this directory, we'll make all example programs that can be run on Microsft Windows platform.

If you want to do .msvc build, please set MSVC compiler environment variables(e.g. vsvars32.bat) before launching make.

Hint: This build process contains auto-checkout demo, so, you should use gmu_DO_CHECKOUT=1 for it to work.
